# Mono-Slam Implementation in ROS

This repository implements the mono-slam algorithm first introduced by [Andrew Davison](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ajd/Publications/davison_etal_pami2007.pdf),
and is the final outcome of the M.Sc. Thesis of [Ludovico O. Russo](https://github.com/ludusrusso)
in the 2013.

## Usage:

```bash
$ rosrun mono-slam mono-slam configuration.cfg /image:=/your_image_topic
```
For my particular setup:
 ``` 
 rosrun mono-slam mono-slam src/mono-slam/conf/conf_firewire.cfg /image:=/camera/image_raw/compressed
 ```


> configuration file contains parameters for the mono-slam algorithm
  and camera calibration.
  Sample configuration files are provided in the "conf" folder
  
  
Notes:
+ Needed to modify CMakeLists.txt before it worked
+ Currently using [tractor_sim](https://github.com/olinrobotics/tractor_sim) for camera feed and example config files
+
